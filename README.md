# PacMan Remake

This is a remake of the arcade game Pacman using Pygame and Pygame_gui. The objective of the game is to collect all the yellow dots (cookies) without being touched by the ghosts moving around the maze. You will be using the arrow keys on a keyboard to control Pacman's movements and the mouse to interact with the menu.

## Installation

You will need to import 2 libraries for this game. To install, type the commands below in the terminal.

**Pygame Library:**

pip install pygame

To start, you will click the "Start Game" button and will be in the game. Move Pacman using the arrow keys and try to collect all cookies. When all cookies are collected, the second level will begin. There is also an option to begin with the second level first. When a "Game Over" or "You Win" screen appears, you can go back to the start menu by pressing any key on the keyboard.
